# Type-Two

Created for the Game Jam of Spring 2019 for the VT Gaming Project Club at Virginia Tech.

A game created by a group of 5 for the VTGP Club GameJam for Spring 2019. Based and inspired by the game “Wario Ware”.

The theme for this GameJam was “Two”. Some groups took this as making a two player game and others made a game that only used two buttons. Our group thought of a simple mini-game where the player just types “two”. From there on, we wanted to make a Wario Ware like game where we created a bunch of mini-games and the type two mini-game was the first of multiple.
